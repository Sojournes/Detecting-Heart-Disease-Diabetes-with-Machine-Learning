# Detecting Heart Disease & Diabetes with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Detecting Heart Disease & Diabetes with Machine Learning project. This comprehensive project will guide you step by step on how to build heart disease and diabetes detection models using Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This project combines machine learning and healthcare analytics, providing an ideal opportunity to level up your data science and programming skills.

## Project Overview

In the introduction, you will learn about machine learning applications in healthcare, including use cases, models, patient data privacy, technical challenges, and limitations. Next, you will dive into how heart disease and diabetes detection models work, covering data collection, preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, model selection, training, and disease detection.

You will also explore the main causes of heart disease and diabetes, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, excessive sugar consumption, and genetics.
